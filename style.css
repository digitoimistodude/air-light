Description: Hi. I'm a starter theme called <code>Air-light</code>, or <em>air</em>, if you like. I'm a theme based on Automattic's underscores and I'm meant for hacking so don't use me as a <em>Parent Theme</em> as-is. Instead try turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. That's what I'm here for.
Version: 5.6.9
